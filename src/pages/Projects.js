            <Project title="Cultivation Digital Marketing" image="https://www.keckkyle.com/images/cultivationdm.jpg">
                I built this project using React.js to replace the previous site of a digital marketer. He gave me his idea for his site and I made them into reality. The rebuild of his included adding a blog feature where he could add articles to his site. I build a PostgreSQL database and used Python with Flask to build a backend to allow the client to add new content to the blog. Then I added API endpoints to display the posts on the main website.

            <Project title="Werkoot" image="https://www.keckkyle.com/images/werkoot.jpg">
                This project was the final project for my Full Stack Quantum Degree program at Next Academy. This project was build in a group of four with the theme 'Hacking Fitness'. For this web app, I build the muscle measure tool using the opencv library for Python to process the image and calculate the circumference of someone's bicep using a photo. Along with this I helped work on the front end design and build the databases.

                This photo sharing app was built using Python and Flask. This is my first full stack project which challenged me to learn how to create and interact with databases.
